# bashVK

This project is archived as
1. VK API has been closed and significantly changed
2. I am no more a VK user
3. This project has never reached the level of the previous API implementation that was lost along with all the data on my hard drive. I didn't do backups properly before 2017.

R.I.P vkontakte

A vk client witten in bash<br>
This is going to be the first (actually, the second) bash vk client. It provides public API that can be used by everyone. It is still in pre-alpha :)
To set it up use ./configure.sh and then you can run it with ./main.sh .Don't forget to add a correct app_id in auth.sh
